MacroQuest is a smart, personal nutrition tracker designed to help users log daily meals, monitor macronutrient intake (calories, protein, fats, carbs), and stay consistent with their health goals.
It makes tracking fast and rewarding by learning from your habits: previously added meals and ingredients are saved for quick future entries.

Each day, MacroQuest automatically evaluates whether you hit your nutritional targets and rewards you with "streaks" or "achievements" when you maintain consistency over time.
The project focuses on simplicity, speed, and habit building, rather than overwhelming you with unnecessary features.
